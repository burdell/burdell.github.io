_whoa_

It's been awhile. So much has changed. Previous little projects have broken. I've seen the errors of the naive Nathan that wrote previous blog posts.

I always have a noble goal of writing more blog posts, but it never happens. Here's an attempt to fix that I guess. I do have a couple of blog posts about some interesting work I've done in the last year or so that I'm going to try and get out. Stay tuned.

I switched static site generators to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) from Wintersmith. Hugo is written in Go rather than being built on top of Node in JavaScript like Wintersmith. 

I think I have these lofty dreams of using a super customizable generator and writing a ton of stuff on my own, but ultimately just lose motivation / get frustrated when I do try to do that. Hugo is unbelievably easy to get started right out of the box. I probably started switching it over about an hour ago and have really enjoyed the out-of-box stuff it provides, like live-reloading. Other site generators I researched could probably be more powerful with tweaking, but Hugo looked like the easiest to get off the ground fastest. The customization process looks pretty painless too. We'll see.
