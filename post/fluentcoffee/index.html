<p>I went to a talk on CoffeeScript a few weeks ago and it sorta sparked my interest in it. I&rsquo;d looked at it a long time ago, but hadn&rsquo;t actually done anything with it, so I decided to write something small to try it out.</p>

<p>The result was <a href="https://github.com/burdell/FluentCoffee">FluentCoffee</a>, a fluent validator. Doing things fluently just means you chain together calls to functions which accomplishes what you&rsquo;re trying to do.</p>

<h3 id="basic-validation:469679c4f97c488a9b9f959f11ebb939">Basic Validation</h3>

<p>Everything hinges off these basic validation functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>GreaterThan</li>
<li>LessThan</li>
<li>Between</li>
<li>EqualTo</li>
<li>Contains</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also <em>Length()</em> and <em>Not()</em> that can be used (where it makes sense).</p>

<p>So for primitive values (strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, etc) you validate them this way:
<pre class="prettyprint">
    primitiveValidation = new Validator()
        .For [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], &ldquo;number array&rdquo;
            .Contains 2
            .Not().Contains(5)
        .For &ldquo;how now brown cow&rdquo;, &ldquo;stupid saying&rdquo;
            .Length().GreaterThan 10
        .For 3 * 10, &ldquo;calculation&rdquo;
            .LessThan 340
            .Between 250, 275
        .For 40 &lt; 50
            .EqualTo true
    .Assert()
</pre></p>

<p>The first parameter is the value, the second is the <em>name</em> of the value. The second parameter is optional, defaulting to &ldquo;Value&rdquo; if you don&rsquo;t include it.</p>

<p>This returns an object with a boolean <em>valid</em> attribute, and list of object that contain the error message and the name of offending value. The above validation would return this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    {
        valid: false,
        errors: [
            {
                value: "calculation",
                message: "calculation must be between 250 and 275"
            }
        ]
    }
</pre>

<h3 id="object-validations:469679c4f97c488a9b9f959f11ebb939">Object Validations</h3>

<p>Object validation has all the same validations, but you just tell it which attribute to validate when you call <em>.For()</em> on it. You have to qualify whether an attribute is required (<em>Require()</em>) or optional (<em>Optional()</em>). If an attribute is required, the validator will check its existance and add an error if it is not there.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    objMe = 
        name: "Nathan Griffin",
        age: 82,
        numberOfAppendages: 20,
        faveCereal: "Honey Bunches of Oats",
        job: "Code Ninja",
        phoneOpSystem: "Android"

    validation = new Validator()
        .For objMe
            .Require "age"
                .LessThan 30
                .Not().EqualTo 29
            .Require "numberOfAppendages"
                .Between 15, 25
            .Require "name"
                .EqualTo "Nathan Griffin"
            .Require "phoneOpSystem"
            .Require "job"
                .Contains "Ninja"
                .Length().GreaterThan 5
            .Optional "nickname"
                .Not().Contains "Dawg" 
        .Assert()
</pre>

<h3 id="function-validation:469679c4f97c488a9b9f959f11ebb939">Function Validation</h3>

<p>For function validation you just call <em>WithParameters()</em> to evaluate the result as one of the previously mentioned validation types (or even one or more function validations if you&rsquo;re feeling sassy)</p>

<p><pre class="prettyprint">
    objMe =
        name: &ldquo;Nathan Griffin&rdquo;,
        job: &ldquo;Code Ninja&rdquo;,
        address: &ldquo;1234 Sesame St Atlanta GA 30305&rdquo;,
        favoriteCereal: &ldquo;Honey Bunches of Oats&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>    objBurdell =
        name: &quot;George P. Burdell&quot;,
        job: &quot;trollol&quot;,
        age: 87,
        favoriteCereal: &quot;Fruit Loops&quot;

    identityFunction = (isMe) -&gt;
        if isMe then objMe else objBurdell

    functionValidation = new Validator()
        .For identityFunction
            .WithParameters true
                .Require &quot;name&quot;
                    .EqualTo &quot;Nathan Griffin&quot;
                .Require &quot;job&quot;
                    .Contains &quot;Ninja&quot;
            .WithParameters()
                .Require &quot;name&quot;
                    .EqualTo &quot;George P. Burdell&quot;
                .Require &quot;job&quot;
                    .Contains &quot;troll&quot;
                .Require &quot;age&quot;
                    .GreaterThan 50
                    .LessThan 90
        .Assert()
</code></pre>

<p></pre>
Not sure if it&rsquo;s obvious, but you can chain all these together. Look at <a href="https://github.com/burdell/FluentCoffee/blob/master/coffeeTester.coffee">coffeeTester.coffee</a> to see that.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s basically it. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s weird stuff / bugs if you try to be stupid with it, so be warned.</p>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;d be cool that it currently doesn&rsquo;t do would be to &ldquo;cache&rdquo; the validation so that I could validate all the steps at one point, do something else, then run the validation again without having to re-state the validations. This would also probably mean that the validations wouldn&rsquo;t actually be evaluated until you called <em>Assert()</em>, which I could see having some value. I almost started to refactor it to do that, but got kinda meh about it since there&rsquo;s something else I want to start.</p>

<p>Some quick thoughts on CoffeeScript&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="hi-h8rs-coffeescript:469679c4f97c488a9b9f959f11ebb939">&ldquo;hi h8rs&rdquo; - CoffeeScript</h3>

<p><em>“There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people&hellip; Religion, Politics, and CoffeeScript.”</em>
― Charles M. Schulz, mostly</p>

<p>In the world of JavaScript, CoffeeScript gets a bunch of hate. It seems most people fall into either the camp of &ldquo;<em>WOW I LOVE THIS</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>THIS IS VILE JIVE</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Most people probably dislike CoffeeScript for the same reason people dislike a bunch of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s unfamiliar</li>
<li>It changes the way they&rsquo;ve done stuff</li>
<li>They misunderstand what it&rsquo;s trying to do</li>
</ul>

<p>I think CoffeeScript really should be though of more like a <em>tool</em> rather than a <em>language</em>. Just like an IDE or a fancy text editor or a linter, CoffeeScript is simply a tool employed to write JavaScript. Yes, it&rsquo;s an abstraction and therefore an intrinsically more complicated way to write it, but at the end of the day you&rsquo;re generating JavaScript. Tools and support for CoffeeScript were (apparently) lacking in the past, but that&rsquo;s just not a valid argument against it anymore. I had zero issues with getting it up and running with Sublime Text on OS X within minutes. And I&rsquo;m sure there are even more tools out there that I didn&rsquo;t take advantage of.</p>

<p>I used to have the commonly held position of <em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to just learn to write GOOD JavaScript&rdquo;</em>, but trying to write anything non-trivial in CoffeeScript actually requires a pretty in-depth understanding of JavaScript. If you don&rsquo;t have a pretty firm grasp of JavaScript, your CoffeeScript is just going to either end up being terrible CoffeeScript instead of terrible JavaScript, or full of weird JavaScript-y CoffeeScript workarounds.</p>

<p>I actually found CoffeeScript to be pretty enjoyable to use. It was simple, yet expressive and did a good job of getting out of your way. No clunky anonymous function declarations, built in null checking (really, this feature alone might be worth it), expressive 1-line conditionals, super easy handling of arbitrary parameter lengths, etc. The list goes on.</p>

<h3 id="but-would-i-want-to-switch-to-coffeescript-permanently:469679c4f97c488a9b9f959f11ebb939">&hellip;but would I want to switch to CoffeeScript permanently?</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;d probably be interested in doing more stuff in CoffeeScript, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m ready to slip into robes of a CoffeeScript evangelist quite yet. If I was part of team where everybody really bought into the idea, I don&rsquo;t think I would hate that. A big part of that is it would be much, much easier to have a syntatically homogenous codebase in CoffeeScript.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, the endgame of CoffeeScript is still JavaScript. I didn&rsquo;t like having the extra step when debugging what I was writing. Luckily, FluentCoffee ended up only being ~120 lines of code, so I pretty much knew where errors were happening. On a much larger codebase I&rsquo;m sure that quickly becomes an issue. Yes, I know sourcemaps exist for this. Which leads to my next point&hellip;</p>

<p>Syntactically the learning curve to CoffeeScript is really nice. But I think the point at which you could truly write it more efficiently than JavaScript takes some investment with the extra tooling needed and the built-in complexity that the Coffeescript -&gt; JavaScript process brings. Maybe it doesn&rsquo;t, but there were times even writing something as relatively simple as FluentCoffee that I was scratching my head a little. Having team members that are invested in really understanding CoffeeScript and tools for it would also really help with this.</p>
