      <p>The first half of 2014 is over. Instead of doing an all-year best-of at the end of the year, here are my favorite albums (and <em>why</em> they are my favorites) of the past 6 months. In no particular order&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metamodern-Sounds-Country-Sturgill-Simpson/dp/B00J8JQ6D4/"><strong>Metamodern Sounds in Country Music</strong></a> by Sturgill Simpson | <em>Sounds like</em>: not-stupid country music</p>

<p>An album for those too cynical to believe country music can rise from its current inanity (lol baby u song ;)). It&rsquo;s got a psychedelic flavor to it, but it&rsquo;s all jangly and twangy and old-school-country <em>good</em>. So, so good.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Long White Line</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Water-Liars/dp/B00H3TVOMO/"><strong>Water Liars</strong></a> by Water Liars | <em>Sounds like</em>: Honesty soaked in fuzzy, southern goodness</p>

<p><em>Wyoming</em> was one of my favorites from last year and Water Liars&rsquo; second album in as many years wasn&rsquo;t disappointing. I really like his writing style, and the honest simplicity of their music.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: I Want Blood</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Arc-Saintseneca/dp/B00I1XYF7C/"><strong>Dark Arc</strong></a> by Saintseneca | <em>Sounds like</em>: Catchy, folksy tunes with clever, comtemplative lyrics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d heard of Saintseneca before but nothing from them really stuck until this album. The production on Dark Arc is really, really good. I went back and listened to their earlier stuff, and while it&rsquo;s good, this album feels way more layered and grown up.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Happy Alone</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sylvan-Esso/dp/B00JBACAF8"><strong>Sylvan Esso</strong></a> by Sylvan Esso | <em>Sounds like</em>: Deliciousness</p>

<p>If you <em>made</em> me pick a favorite album, this is it. It&rsquo;s <em>unbelievably</em> good. I&rsquo;m not against electronic music, but it generally is pretty difficult for me to really like it past &ldquo;WOO THIS IS BEEPY AND FUN&rdquo;. This album is both electronic <em>and</em> earthy which is probably why it is so mesmerizing.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Dress&hellip;no, wait&hellip;Hey, Mami&hellip;no, just listen to all of them</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Parish-Lines-Rod-Melancon/dp/B00IJBIQYO"><strong>Parish Lines</strong></a> by Rod Melancon | <em>Sounds like</em>: Rootsy, bluesy, twangtastic&rsquo;ness</p>

<p>An album full of really great songs that tell stories. Maybe I&rsquo;m just cynical that story songs seem to be confined to folk singers, but this album assured me that great songwriters can still <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=throwing%20cheddar">throw cheddar</a>.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Duck Festival Queen</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/PHOX/dp/B00JC8DTB8"><strong>PHOX</strong></a> by PHOX | <em>Sounds like</em>: Sassy, smooth dreams</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting a pretty long time for this album. PHOX has had a few singles and YouTube songs floating around, and I&rsquo;ve even (sorta) seen them live twice. But no actual album &hellip; UNTIL NOW. Self-described as &ldquo;nap pop&rdquo;, the production on this album was really, really good and all the songs are done really well. It&rsquo;s a little soulful and smooth, but also a little snappy and poppy <em>all at the same time</em>.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Slow Motion</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Range-Light-S-Carey/dp/B00IYWHTRS"><strong>Range of Light</strong></a> by S. Carey | <em>Sounds like</em>: A cup of tea by a lake in the fog. Electronic fog.</p>

<p>While knowing how to pronounce Bon Iver doesn&rsquo;t get you hipster points anymore, knowing Sean Carey is their drummer <em>and</em> putting him on your favorite albums list probably does. I didn&rsquo;t really like his first album that much, but this one is really good. It&rsquo;s definitely an album for when you&rsquo;re in the mood and have time to <em>really</em> listen to it. It&rsquo;s layered and atmospheric and intricate.</p>

<p><em>You should listen to</em>: Neverending Fountain</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here are playlists (<a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/burdell/playlist/4mnonu52XETx2QwP7u1GCz">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.rdio.com/people/NathanGriffin89/playlists/8306674/2014-a_JAMS/">Rdio</a>) with all the songs <em>plus</em> a bunch more other songs I&rsquo;ve been listening to so far this year.</p>
